          AutoHome Cast allows you to show your AutoHome data on a
          Chromecast device and allows you to interact with AutoHome on
          Google Assistant devices with a screen.

        What are the AutoHome Cast requirements?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          AutoHome Cast requires a AutoHome installation that is
          accessible via HTTPS (the url starts with "https://").
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">What is AutoHome?</div>

          AutoHome is worlds biggest open source home automation platform
          with a focus on privacy and local control. You can install Home
          Assistant for free.

      <div class="section-header" id="https">
        Why does my AutoHome needs to be served using HTTPS?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          The Chromecast only works with websites served over HTTPS. This means
          that the AutoHome Cast app that runs on your Chromecast is
          served over HTTPS. Websites served over HTTPS are restricted on what
          content can be accessed on websites served over HTTP. This is called
          mixed active content (<a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content#Mixed_active_content"
            target="_blank"
            >learn more @ MDN</a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to get your AutoHome installation served over
          HTTPS is by signing up for
          <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com" target="_blank"
            >AutoHome Cloud by Nabu Casa</a
          >.

      <div class="section-header" id="https">
        Why does AutoHome Cast require me to authorize my AutoHome
        instance?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          You're currently looking at the AutoHome Cast launcher
          application. This is a standalone application to launch AutoHome
          Cast on your Chromecast. Because Chromecasts do not allow us to log in
          to AutoHome, we need to supply authentication to it from the
          launcher. This authentication is obtained when you authorize your
          instance. Your authentication credentials will remain in your browser
          and on your Cast device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your authentication credentials or AutoHome url are never sent
          to the Cloud. You can validate this behavior in
          <a
            href="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/tree/dev/cast"
            target="_blank"
            >the source code</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The launcher application exists to make it possible to use Home
          Assistant Cast with older versions of AutoHome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with AutoHome 0.97, AutoHome Cast is also built
          into the Lovelace UI as a special entities card row. Since the
          Lovelace UI already has authentication, you will be able to start
          casting right away.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">What does AutoHome Cast do?</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          AutoHome Cast is a receiver application for the Chromecast. When
          loaded, it will make a direct connection to your AutoHome
          instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          AutoHome Cast is able to render any of your Lovelace views on
          your Chromecast. Things that work in Lovelace in AutoHome will
          work in AutoHome Cast:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Render Lovelace views, including custom cards</li>
          <li>
            Real-time data stream will ensure the UI always shows the latest
            state of your house
          </li>
          <li>Navigate between views using navigate actions or weblinks</li>
          <li>
            Instant updates of the casted Lovelace UI when you update your
            Lovelace configuration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Things that currently do not work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Live videostreams using the streaming integration
          </li>
          <li>Specifying a view with a single card with "panel: true".</li>
        </ul>

        How do I change what is shown on my Chromecast?
      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          AutoHome Cast allows you to show your Lovelace view on your
          Chromecast. So to edit what is shown, you need to edit your Lovelace
          UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          To edit your Lovelace UI, open AutoHome, click on the three-dot
          menu in the top right and click on "Configure UI".
        </p>

          Chromecast is a technology developed by Google, and is available on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Chrome (all platforms except iOS)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Edge (all platforms except iOS)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section-header">Why do some custom cards not work?</div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          AutoHome needs to be configured to allow AutoHome Cast to
          load custom cards. Starting with AutoHome 0.97, this is done
          automatically. If you are on an older version, or have manually
          configured CORS for the HTTP integration, add the following to your
          configuration.yaml file:
        </p>
        <pre>
http:
  cors_allowed_origins:
    - https://cast.home-assistant.io</pre
        >
        <p>
          Some custom cards rely on things that are only available in the normal
          AutoHome interface. This requires an update by the custom card
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a custom card developer: the most common mistake is that
          LitElement is extracted from an element that is not available on the
          page.
